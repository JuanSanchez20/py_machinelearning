# Machine Learning Experimentation Notebook.
This repository is dedicated to practice and experimentation with small Machine Learning projects using.

Here I will share the small projects, the techniques I am exploring and the approaches I am trying, with the aim of keeping track of what I have learned over time.

## What will you find in this repository?
* Personal projects: Small experiments and practices that I carry out to familiarize myself with different ML concepts and tools.
* Reflections and experiments: Explanations about the decisions I made, the algorithms I used, and the results obtained.
* Evolution of my learning: From the first steps to more complex topics, showing how I am improving and refining my skills.
* Codes and Notebooks: Model implementations and data analysis that reflect my understanding of the topics I explore.

## Repository objectives
* Document the learning process: It is a personal space where I share my progress, experiments and reflections on Machine Learning.
* Explore and experiment: Try different ML techniques, algorithms and frameworks to understand how they work and how they are applied.
* Showing my progress: As I gain new knowledge, this repository will be updated with more complex projects and methods.

This repository is a workbook and learning journal where I will record my evolution in the field of Machine Learning.
